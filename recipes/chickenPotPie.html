    <li>1 cup butter, cubed</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1-3/4 teaspoons salt </li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>1-1/2 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>4 cups cubed cooked chicken </li>
    <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
    <li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
    <li>4 sheets refrigerated pie crust</li>


</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong><p>Preheat oven to 425°. Place potatoes and carrots in a large saucepan; add water to cover. 
            Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, covered, 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong><p>In a large skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender. Stir in flour and seasonings until blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir 2 minutes or until thickened. 
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong><p>Stir in chicken, peas, corn and potato-carrot mixture; remove from heat.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong><p>Unroll a pie crust into each of two 9-in. pie plates; trim crusts even with rims of plates. Add chicken mixture. Unroll remaining crusts; place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in tops.</p></li>
Bake 35-40 minutes or until crust is lightly browned. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting.<br>
Freeze option: Cover and freeze unbaked pies. To use, remove from freezer 30 minutes before baking (do not thaw). Preheat oven to 425°. Place pies on baking sheets; cover edges loosely with foil. Bake 30 minutes. Reduce oven setting to 350°; bake 70-80 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and a thermometer inserted in center reads 165°.</p></li>
